## Inspiration

A critical common thread that lies at the core of all the women empowerment initiatives is financial independence. Empowerment means giving someone the ability to “control their life and claim their rights”. Financial independence is not only a source of confidence but also gives women the credibility to participate in important matters of decision making, for themselves and their families.

**Financial Independence should be the new age Self-Care Initiative for Women Empowerment.** 

Thus we bring to you WomenGenix, a web application that empowers women to earn money by selling their own authentic self-made products and creative abilities from home & providing reliable services on the go. Our aim is to make women feel independent and self-cared.

## What it does

Our web application provides women of all age groups an opportunity to be financially independent by posting about the services which they can provide and products which they are capable of selling. Potential buyers can see these posts and contact these women if they are interested in the said services.

We also have a page from where women can look for work oppotunities and aplly for them in case they are interested. 


## How we built it

We have built this website using javascript, HTML and CSS. We have also used sass to make the website dynamic and responsive. 

For the opportunities page, we are using Indeed API to get the latest job oppotunities for women.
